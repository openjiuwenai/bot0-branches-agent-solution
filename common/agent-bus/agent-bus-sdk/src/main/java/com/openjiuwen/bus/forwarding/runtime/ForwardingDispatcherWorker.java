/**
 * Minimal dispatcher worker that drives claimed outbox records to a terminal
 * state through the abstract delivery port (Stage 8 plan §3 slice 5).
 *
 * <p>This is the claim / deliver / ack / retry half of the forwarding lifecycle,
 * kept separate from {@code ForwardingDispatcher} (the accept / enqueue gateway
 * role) per MI8-003. A single synchronous {@link #runOnce} tick:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>claims due records via {@link ForwardingOutboxClaimPort#claimDue} (each
 *       already atomically transitioned to DISPATCHING and leased to the worker);</li>
 *   <li>delivers each via {@link ForwardingDeliveryPort#deliver}, consuming only
 *       the opaque {@code routeHandle} (never a physical endpoint);</li>
 *   <li>maps the {@link ForwardingDeliveryResult} to the matching outbox state
 *       transition — ACKED / RETRY_SCHEDULED / DLQ / EXPIRED — carrying the
 *       caller's {@code leaseOwner} so the mutation is lease-owner guarded
 *       (Stage 9, MI9-001): a record reclaimed by another worker between claim
 *       and ack is rejected, not mutated. A rejected mutation raises
 *       {@link ForwardingLeaseException}; the worker treats it as "skip this
 *       record" (Stage 10, MI10-001) — counted as {@code skipped} and the tick
 *       continues, so one reclaimed record never aborts the whole tick.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The worker holds no threads, no scheduler, no registry, no transport. Real
 * polling cadence, threading, backpressure and a concrete delivery binding are
 * deferred to a later stage; Stage 8 ships this skeleton so the ACK / RETRY /
 * DLQ / EXPIRED paths can be exercised with a fake delivery port. The worker
 * never writes Task execution state.
 *
 * <p>Lease renewal (Stage 10, MI10-002; Stage 11, MI11-001): a {@code deliver}
 * that outlives the lease TTL would lose the lease and fail the ack. The worker
 * carries a {@link DispatchLeasePolicy} and an {@link EpochClock}; before each
 * delivery it reads the live clock and, if the remaining lease TTL
 * ({@code leaseUntil - clockNow}) is below the policy threshold, calls
 * {@link ForwardingOutboxClaimPort#renewLease} to extend the lease. (Before Stage
 * 11 the check used the tick-start instant, so the remainder never shrank inside
 * a tick and renewal could not fire under a natural dispatch loop.) A renew that
 * returns {@code false} (reclaimed / not DISPATCHING) is treated exactly like a
 * {@link ForwardingLeaseException}: the record is skipped, not delivered. The
 * in-memory harness checks owner, not lease expiry, so "renew-or-lose-the-ack"
 * is encoded as a SQL contract in {@code forwarding-persistence.md §7.2}, not
 * asserted in-memory.
 *
 * <p>Exception contract (Stage 11, MI11-002 / MI11-003): within a tick the worker
 * never propagates a per-record failure. A {@link ForwardingLeaseException} from
 * the lease guard, or a non-lease {@link RuntimeException} from {@code deliver}
 * (a real transport binding MUST map transport errors to a
 * {@link ForwardingDeliveryResult} and not throw — see the ICD), is swallowed as
 * a {@code skipped} record (left DISPATCHING, reclaimed on lease expiry) and the
 * tick continues. {@code runOnce} throws {@link IllegalArgumentException} only
 * for illegal arguments (blank tenant / lease owner, non-positive limit) — a
 * caller bug the dispatch loop fails fast on rather than masking.
 *
 * <p>Circuit breaker (Stage 16): before each delivery the worker asks the injected
 * {@link ForwardingCircuitBreaker} {@link ForwardingCircuitBreaker#allowsDelivery};
 * an OPEN route is short-circuited along the existing skip path (skipped, left
 * DISPATCHING, reclaimed on lease expiry, consuming no attemptCount). After each
 * delivery the outcome is fed back via
 * {@link ForwardingCircuitBreaker#recordOutcome} — once from the deliver-exception
 * catch (as a {@code RECEIVER_UNAVAILABLE} failure) and once with the real result
 * before the state mutation — so the breaker's {@code probeInFlight} marker can
 * never strand a HALF_OPEN probe regardless of which path a record takes. The
 * default {@link ForwardingCircuitBreaker#ALWAYS_CLOSED} no-op keeps the pre-Stage-16
 * behaviour when no breaker is injected.
