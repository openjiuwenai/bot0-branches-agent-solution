/**
 * Per-route circuit-breaker seam for the C3 forwarding dispatcher.
 *
 * <p><b>Stage 14 — port reserved, not wired.</b> Stage 13 separated the
 * deliver-retry subitem (timing of a retryable failure — now owned by
 * {@link ForwardingRetryPolicy}) from circuit-breaking (per-route
 * failure-rate governance). Stage 14 shipped this port + the
 * {@link #ALWAYS_CLOSED} no-op but intentionally did NOT wire it into
 * {@link ForwardingDispatcherWorker}: a real breaker needs
 * per-{@link ForwardingRouteHandle} failure-rate state and its shape depends
 * on the transport model — a <b>push</b> model (T1 / T2) has the dispatcher
 * driving delivery, so it needs the breaker to actively short-circuit a
 * failing route; a <b>consumer-pull</b> model (T3) is inherently self-paced
 * (the receiver simply stops claiming), so an explicit breaker is largely
 * redundant. Wiring before that decision would bake in a transport assumption.
 *
 * <p><b>Stage 15 — the blocker fell.</b> The real delivery binding PoC chose
 * <b>T1</b> (synchronous wait-for-completion = dispatcher-push over sync RPC,
 * mirroring main's {@code A2aRemoteAgentOutboundAdapter}). T1 is a push model,
 * so the dispatcher drives delivery and needs the breaker to actively
 * short-circuit a failing route — the suspended precondition landed.
 *
 * <p><b>Stage 16 — wired into the worker.</b> A real three-state implementation
 * ({@link RouteCircuitBreaker}) now backs this port. Before each delivery the
 * worker calls {@link #allowsDelivery}; an OPEN route is short-circuited
 * (skipped, left DISPATCHING, reclaimed on lease expiry — like the existing
 * lease / deliver-exception skip paths, consuming no attemptCount). After each
 * delivery the worker calls {@link #recordOutcome} to feed the result back; the
 * breaker classifies it internally (ACKED → success, a retryable failure →
 * failure, DLQ / EXPIRED → ignored). The port stays transport-agnostic — it
 * consumes only {@link ForwardingRouteHandle} / {@link ForwardingDeliveryResult}
 * — so even if H2/H3 ultimately rules T3, the wired breaker does no harm (a
 * self-paced receiver already stops claiming, so the breaker rarely trips).
 *
 * <p>Plain JDK-portable type — no Spring, JDBC, broker or scheduler dependency
 * (forwarding purity, decision §6.1).
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code docs/architecture/l0/10-governance/review-packets/
