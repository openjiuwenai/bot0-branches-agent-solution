/**
 * Convention-based {@link ForwardingEndpointResolver} for the FEAT-013/014 broker
 * topology (arch-driven G5-B).
 *
 * <p>Maps an opaque {@link ForwardingRouteHandle} to a broker topic by the L2 §5.2
 * naming convention: {@code ascend_bus_<routeHandle.value>_<suffix>}, where the
 * per-form / per-role {@code suffix} selects the hop ({@code req} gateway-produce /
 * {@code deliver} event-bus-forward-produce / {@code resp_in} event-bus-response-consume /
 * {@code resp_out} gateway-response-consume). This is the sanctioned HD4 place to read
 * {@code routeHandle.value()} — it keeps the per-form topic routing in the resolver
 * layer, not in the worker (the {@code EventBusRelayWorker} is routing-agnostic; it
 * re-publishes via whatever {@link BrokerForwardingRelayPort} it is wired with).
 *
 * <p>Replaces the test-inline {@link MapEndpointResolver} for production wiring — the
 * route→topic map is derived by convention, not a static config map (the route set is
 * not known at config time; it comes from envelopes at runtime). Recorded as the
 * route→topic mapping sub-decision in {@code docs/4plus1/delta/event-bus-relay/deviations.md}.
 *
 * <p>Plain JDK — no Spring / broker types (forwarding purity preserved).
