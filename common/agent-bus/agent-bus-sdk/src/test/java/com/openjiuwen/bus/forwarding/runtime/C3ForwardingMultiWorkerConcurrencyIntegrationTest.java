/**
 * Stage 21 (MI21-001 / MI21-002) &mdash; <b>multi-worker concurrency</b>
 * verification of the C3 dispatch loop on real persistence. A pure-test stage:
 * no production code changes. It closes the two Stage 20 deferrals that were
 * explicitly recorded as "verified only single-threaded":
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Concurrent claim under real contention.</b> Stage 12's
 *       {@code ForwardingJdbcIntegrationTest} proved {@code claimDue}'s
 *       {@code FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED} yields no duplicate <em>claims</em> in a
 *       2-thread unit test, and Stages 17&ndash;20 drove the full
 *       claim&rarr;deliver&rarr;ack chain &mdash; but only ever from a single
 *       worker instance per tick (Stage 20 scenario A simulated "another worker
 *       takes over" by reclaiming under a <em>different</em> lease owner on a
 *       later tick, never two workers racing the same instant). Whether N real
 *       workers, each running their own {@code runOnce} loop against the
 *       <em>same</em> shared outbox, really partition the work with zero
 *       duplicate deliveries and every record reaching its terminal state, was
 *       never exercised end to end.</li>
 *   <li><b>Shared circuit-breaker singleton under concurrency.</b> Stage 16
 *       wired {@link RouteCircuitBreaker} into the worker and verified the full
 *       state machine single-threaded (Stage 20 scenario B). The deferred note
 *       (Stage 16 risks) said: "a single {@code RouteCircuitBreaker} instance
 *       shared across worker <em>threads</em> is safe under
 *       {@code synchronized(RouteState)}; but the question of whether that
 *       actually holds under real concurrent {@code recordOutcome} traffic was
 *       left to production." This stage answers it.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Two scenarios, both on REAL persistence (embedded-postgres + Flyway +
 * {@link JdbcForwardingOutbox}), both <b>not</b> booting the runtime:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   A. concurrent claim &mdash; no duplicate deliveries
 *        enqueue M=20 PENDING records (same tenant/route, distinct message ids);
 *        N=4 worker threads, each its own {@code ForwardingDispatcherWorker} with a
 *        distinct lease owner, all sharing the SAME outbox + an atomic-counting
 *        delivery port (every {@code deliver} increments a counter and returns
 *        acked). A {@link CountDownLatch} releases all four simultaneously; each
 *        worker loops {@code runOnce} until {@code claimDue} returns nothing.
 *        Assert: the delivery counter == 20 (each record delivered EXACTLY once
 *        &mdash; if SKIP LOCKED failed and two workers claimed the same row, the
 *        loser's {@code markAcked} would trip the lease guard and skip, but the
 *        delivery port would already have been invoked a second time, so the
 *        counter would exceed 20); every record == ACKED; aggregate
 *        claimed/acked == 20.
 *
 *   B. shared breaker under concurrency &mdash; coherent OPEN
 *        enqueue M=12 PENDING records (same route); N=4 workers all sharing the
 *        SAME {@code RouteCircuitBreaker(2, very-large-cooldown, clock)} and a
 *        delivery port that always returns retry(RECEIVER_UNAVAILABLE). All four
 *        race {@code runOnce}. Assert: {@code breaker.stateOf(route) == OPEN}
 *        (consecutive failures crossed the threshold coherently &mdash; the
 *        {@code synchronized(RouteState)} block prevented a lost-update on
 *        {@code consecutiveFailures} or a torn state transition; and the OPEN
 *        state is <em>visible</em> to every worker via the
 *        {@code ConcurrentHashMap} memory-visibility guarantee); no worker threw
 *        (no {@code ConcurrentModificationException}, no illegal state); every
 *        per-tick {@code DispatchTickResult} stays self-consistent, so the
 *        aggregate does too; no record reached ACKED (the port never acks).
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Why scenario A's delivery counter is the smoking gun.</b> The lease
 * guard ({@code markAcked} rejects a record whose owner changed) is a
 * <em>second-line</em> defence: even if two workers both transitioned a row to
 * DISPATCHING, only one's ack would land and the other's would be skipped
 * &mdash; so the persisted end state could still look correct (one ACKED). The
 * delivery counter sits <em>before</em> the guard: it counts every
 * {@code deliver} invocation regardless of whether the subsequent ack succeeds.
 * A counter greater than M is direct proof of a duplicate claim that SKIP LOCKED
 * should have prevented. {@code == M} is direct proof it held.
 *
 * <p><b>Why scenario B's cooldown is very large.</b> The goal is to drive CLOSED
 * &rarr; OPEN under concurrent failures and verify the OPEN is coherent and
 * visible &mdash; <em>not</em> to re-verify the HALF_OPEN probe lifecycle (that
 * was Stage 20 scenario B, single-threaded, where time could be advanced
 * deterministically). Advancing the shared {@link MutableEpochClock} from
 * multiple threads while a HALF_OPEN probe is in flight would introduce a real
 * race between the cooldown check and {@code recordOutcome}; keeping the clock
 * frozen at {@code t0} with a cooldown far beyond it means the breaker can only
 * reach OPEN, never HALF_OPEN, so the only concurrent state writes are the
 * CLOSED&rarr;OPEN transition itself &mdash; exactly the lost-update hazard the
 * test targets.
 *
 * <p><b>Time control (reused from Stage 19/20).</b> A {@link MutableEpochClock}
 * frozen at {@code t0} (the test's real start) is injected into every worker.
 * The claim instant ({@code nowMillisEpoch}) and the delivery instant both read
 * {@code t0}; since delivery always returns a fixed outcome, the
 * {@code nextAttemptAt} basis is irrelevant. The injected {@code t0} also keeps
 * {@code RETRY_SCHEDULED} rows from being reclaimed in scenario B:
 * {@code nextAttemptAt = t0 + 100ms > t0 = now}, so {@code claimDue}'s
 * {@code RETRY_SCHEDULED} reclaim clause never fires and each worker's loop
 * terminates cleanly once the PENDING set is exhausted. No thread advances the
 * clock.
 *
 * <p><b>Real-clock guard constraint.</b> {@link JdbcForwardingOutbox}'s
 * lease-guarded mutations gate on {@code lease_until > System.currentTimeMillis()}
 * using the <b>real</b> wall clock. So the lease is set to {@code t0 + 120s}
 * (passed as {@code leaseUntilMillisEpoch}); the test finishes in well under
 * that, so the real clock never catches the lease and the guard never misfires
 * under contention. This IT touches no production code.
 *
 * <p><b>No runtime boot.</b> Neither scenario needs a real A2A server: both
 * inject the delivery outcome. So this IT boots only embedded-postgres + Flyway
 * + the outbox &mdash; lighter than Stage 17 / 18. The claim / lease / breaker
 * behaviour is REAL (real SQL {@code claimDue}, real {@code markAcked}, real
 * {@code RouteCircuitBreaker} state machine); only the delivery outcome is
 * injected.
 *
 * <p><b>&sect;6.2 unchanged.</b> Both scenarios use {@code CONTROL_ONLY}
 * envelopes; the time-control / counting helpers are test-scope plain-JDK &mdash;
 * no concrete broker/MQ, no payload body / token stream / Task state, no
 * cross-tenant fallback.
 *
 * <p><b>@Isolated</b> (Stage 19 finding, reused Stage 20): the parent pom runs
 * surefire 4-way concurrent, and these context-boot ITs match the surefire (not
 * failsafe) name pattern, so they would otherwise land on the concurrent runner;
 * Spring Boot 4's {@code SpringApplication.run} is not thread-safe. This IT does
 * not boot Spring, but it spawns its <em>own</em> worker threads and shares the
 * embedded-postgres boot recipe, so {@code @Isolated} keeps it exclusive.
