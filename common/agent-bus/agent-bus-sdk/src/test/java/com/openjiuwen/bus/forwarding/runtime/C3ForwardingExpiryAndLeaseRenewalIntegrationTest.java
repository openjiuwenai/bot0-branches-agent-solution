/**
 * Stage 22 (MI22-001 / MI22-002) &mdash; end-to-end verification of the two
 * time-driven terminal / renewal paths the prior stages verified only at the
 * unit / contract layer or left as a SQL-correct-but-untriggered path, closing
 * the last two blind spots of the C3 dispatch loop's <em>time</em> surface.
 *
 * <p>Stages 17&ndash;21 closed the three end-to-end lifelines (retry round-trip,
 * lease reclaim, circuit breaker, single- and multi-worker) but recorded two
 * time-driven paths as still-unverified end to end:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The EXPIRED terminal state end to end.</b>
 *       {@link ForwardingDispatcherWorker}'s {@code case EXPIRED} branch calls
 *       {@link JdbcForwardingOutbox#markExpired}, a lease-guarded UPDATE that
 *       flips a DISPATCHING row to EXPIRED and clears its lease &mdash; but it was
 *       verified only by a contract test against the in-memory harness, never on
 *       real SQL through the worker. The third terminal state (after ACKED =
 *       Stage 17, DLQ = Stage 18) had no end-to-end proof that the persisted row
 *       actually lands EXPIRED with the right invariant (a non-null
 *       {@code last_failure_code}, a released lease) and is then never reclaimed.</li>
 *   <li><b>Lease renewal actually firing end to end.</b>
 *       MI11-001 wired a renewal check into the worker (before Stage 11 the check
 *       read the tick-start instant, so the remainder never shrank inside a tick
 *       and renewal could not fire under a natural dispatch loop). The fix reads
 *       the live injected clock; but whether a real {@code claimDue}&rarr;
 *       {@code renewLease}&rarr;{@code deliver} tick actually <em>renews</em> a
 *       short lease before delivery, on real persistence, was deferred. Stage 20
 *       used {@link ForwardingDispatcherWorker.DispatchLeasePolicy#DISABLED}
 *       throughout, so renewal never fired in any end-to-end IT.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Stage 22 closes both, on REAL persistence (embedded-postgres + Flyway +
 * {@link JdbcForwardingOutbox}). Two scenarios:
 * <pre>
 *   A. EXPIRED terminal state end to end
 *        enqueue PENDING &rarr; MutableEpochClock(t0) + fake delivery returning
 *          expired() + DISABLED lease + ALWAYS_CLOSED breaker &rarr; one tick &rarr;
 *          markExpired (lease-guarded UPDATE) &rarr; persisted EXPIRED.
 *        expired=1, attempt_count=0 (EXPIRED is terminal, never retried),
 *        last_failure_code='delivery_timeout' (markExpired's hard-coded code),
 *        lease_owner/lease_until = NULL (lease released). A second tick then
 *        claims NOTHING for this row &mdash; EXPIRED is terminal, it is not in
 *        claimDue's candidate set (PENDING / RETRY_SCHEDULED / DISPATCHING), so it
 *        is never reclaimed. Aggregate claimed=1 across 2 ticks (not 2).
 *
 *   B. lease renewal actually firing end to end
 *        enqueue PENDING &rarr; MutableEpochClock(t0) + leaseDuration=30s (claim
 *          sets lease_until=t0+30s) + DispatchLeasePolicy(renewBefore=50s,
 *          extend=60s) + an OBSERVING delivery port that, at deliver time, reads
 *          the live PG row and asserts lease_until==t0+90s (the renewed value)
 *          and lease_owner==this worker, then acks &rarr; one tick &rarr; the
 *          renewal check (remaining = (t0+30s) - t0 = 30s &lt; 50s) fires
 *          renewLease(msg, t0+90s) BEFORE deliver &rarr; deliver observes the
 *          renewed lease &rarr; markAcked &rarr; ACKED.
 *        acked=1, skipped=0 (the renew succeeded), renewalObserved=true (the
 *          observing port saw the extended lease at deliver time), attempt_count=0.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Key finding (scenario A): EXPIRED is SQL-correct but trigger-source-missing.</b>
 * The {@link com.openjiuwen.bus.forwarding.spi.ForwardingOutboxRecord} does
 * not persist a deadline field (the {@link ForwardingEnvelope} carries
 * {@code deadlineMillisEpoch}, but it is not projected onto the persisted row),
 * and {@link com.openjiuwen.bus.forwarding.runtime.transport.a2a.A2aForwardingDeliveryPort#deliver}
 * does not consult the deadline &mdash; so a real A2A delivery never returns
 * {@link ForwardingDeliveryResult#expired()}. The EXPIRED path is therefore
 * exercised here by an <em>injected</em> {@code expired()} outcome, exactly as
 * Stage 18 injected {@code dlq(...)} for the DLQ path. This proves the
 * {@code markExpired} SQL contract is correct (EXPIRED lands with the right
 * invariant and is terminal), but the <em>real trigger source</em> &mdash; a
 * deadline field on the record + a DDL column + a deliver-time deadline check
 * &mdash; is recorded as deferred (a schema change, out of scope for this
 * verification stage). The hard-coded {@code last_failure_code='delivery_timeout'}
 * inside {@code markExpired} satisfies the record invariant (EXPIRED requires a
 * non-null {@code last_failure_code}) and is a retryable code, which is
 * semantically muddled but harmless: EXPIRED is terminal, so the code is never
 * consulted for a retry decision.
 *
 * <p><b>Scenario B is pure arithmetic (the MI11-001 design dividend).</b> Because
 * the renewal check reads the <em>injected</em> {@link EpochClock}, not the real
 * wall clock, freezing the clock at {@code T0} and claiming with a short lease
 * ({@code lease_until = T0+30s}) makes {@code remaining = 30s} &mdash; below the
 * 50s threshold &mdash; without any sleep. The renewal thus fires deterministically
 * on the very first tick, CI-stable. The smoking gun that renewal <em>really</em>
 * happened is the observing delivery port reading the renewed
 * {@code lease_until = T0+90s} from PG <em>at deliver time</em> &mdash; a value
 * that could only exist if {@code renewLease} committed its UPDATE before
 * {@code deliver} ran.
 *
 * <p><b>Real-clock guard constraint.</b> {@link JdbcForwardingOutbox}'s
 * lease-guarded mutations ({@code markExpired} / {@code markAcked}) gate on
 * {@code lease_until > System.currentTimeMillis()} using the <b>real</b> wall
 * clock, not the injected one. So the tick instants start at {@code T0} (the
 * test's real start moment) and the claim lease ({@code T0+60s} in A,
 * {@code T0+30s}&rarr;renewed {@code T0+90s} in B) always exceeds the real clock,
 * so the lease guard never misfires. This IT touches no production code; the
 * real-clock lease semantics stay as-is.
 *
 * <p><b>No runtime boot.</b> Neither scenario needs a real A2A server: scenario A
 * injects the {@code expired()} outcome; scenario B injects {@code acked()} via
 * an observing port. So this IT boots only embedded-postgres + Flyway + the
 * outbox &mdash; lighter than Stage 17 / 18. The EXPIRED / renewal behaviour is
 * REAL (real SQL {@code markExpired} / {@code renewLease}); only the delivery
 * outcome is injected.
 *
 * <p><b>&sect;6.2 unchanged.</b> Both scenarios use a {@code CONTROL_ONLY}
 * envelope; the time-control helpers / observing port are test-scope plain-JDK
 * &mdash; no concrete broker/MQ, no payload body / token stream / Task state, no
 * cross-tenant fallback.
 *
 * <p><b>@Isolated</b> (Stage 19 finding): the parent pom runs surefire 4-way
 * concurrent, and these context-boot ITs match the surefire (not failsafe) name
 * pattern, so they would otherwise land on the concurrent runner; Spring Boot 4's
 * {@code SpringApplication.run} is not thread-safe, so concurrent boot flaked
 * ({@code ConcurrentModificationException}). {@code @Isolated} makes each run
 * exclusive, and these ITs share the embedded-postgres boot recipe.
