/**
 * Per-route three-state circuit breaker for the C3 forwarding dispatcher
 * (Stage 16 — the real implementation behind {@link ForwardingCircuitBreaker},
 * wired into {@link ForwardingDispatcherWorker}).
 *
 * <p>State machine (one {@link RouteState} per opaque
 * {@link ForwardingRouteHandle#value()}):
 * <pre>
 *   CLOSED --(failureThreshold consecutive failures)--> OPEN --(cooldown)--> HALF_OPEN
 *   HALF_OPEN --(probe success)--> CLOSED ; HALF_OPEN --(probe failure)--> OPEN
 * </pre>
 * The worker calls {@link #allowsDelivery} before each delivery — an OPEN route
 * short-circuits (the record is skipped, left DISPATCHING, reclaimed on lease
 * expiry, consuming no attemptCount — exactly the existing skip paths). After
 * each delivery it calls {@link #recordOutcome} to advance the machine.
 *
 * <p><b>Outcome classification</b> is internal (the worker passes the raw
 * {@link ForwardingDeliveryResult} once and does not care how it is classified):
 * {@link Outcome#ACKED} is a success (resets the count / closes a probe);
 * {@link Outcome#RETRY_SCHEDULED} is a failure — a retryable code (timeout /
 * receiver-unavailable / backpressure) is a route-unhealthy signal — that
 * increments the count or re-opens; {@link Outcome#DLQ} /
 * {@link Outcome#EXPIRED} are ignored (a non-retryable failure is a config
 * error, a retryable-exhausted failure was already counted on its earlier
 * RETRY_SCHEDULED, and an EXPIRED record hit its own deadline). Note
 * {@link ForwardingDeliveryResult#retry} already rejects a non-retryable code
 * (Stage 9 classification), so a RETRY_SCHEDULED outcome is always a retryable
 * failure — the breaker never re-checks {@code failureCode.retryable()}.
 *
 * <p><b>HALF_OPEN single probe.</b> At most one in-flight probe is permitted per
 * route (the {@code probeInFlight} marker). The worker's call ordering makes
 * this marker leak-proof: {@code allowsDelivery} runs AFTER the lease-renewal
 * check (a renew failure skips before the breaker is touched) and BEFORE
 * delivery; {@code recordOutcome} runs AFTER delivery and BEFORE the state
 * mutation (a lease-guard exception in the mutation cannot strand a probe); and
 * the deliver-exception catch feeds a {@code RECEIVER_UNAVAILABLE} failure so a
 * probe that threw is still closed out. See Stage 16 plan §(4).
 *
 * <p>Plain JDK-portable type — no Spring, JDBC, broker or scheduler dependency
 * (forwarding purity, decision §6.1). Per-route state lives in process memory
 * (a {@link ConcurrentHashMap}); a process restart loses it (returns to CLOSED).
 * Cross-process sharing / persistence of breaker state is deferred.
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code architecture/L2-Low-Level-Design/agent-bus/forwarding-persistence.md §17};
 * Stage 16 plan §3.
