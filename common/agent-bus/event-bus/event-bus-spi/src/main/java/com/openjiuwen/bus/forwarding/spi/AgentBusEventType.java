/**
 * Event-type discriminator carried on every {@link ForwardingEnvelope}
 * (FEAT-013 + FEAT-014). It lets the gateway, event-bus (治理中继), and
 * agent-runtime route / fan-out / merge invocation and A2A-call events without
 * unpacking the A2A payload.
 *
 * <p>Two families, four directions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>FEAT-013 — client invocation</b>: {@code CLIENT_INVOCATION_*}
 *       (client → server, via gateway → event-bus → agent-runtime) and
 *       {@code INVOCATION_*} (server → gateway, via agent-runtime → event-bus
 *       → gateway).</li>
 *   <li><b>FEAT-014 — service-to-service A2A call</b>:
 *       {@code A2A_CALL_*} / {@code A2A_STREAM_*} (source runtime ↔ target
 *       runtime, via event-bus).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code INVOCATION_ACCEPTED} / {@code A2A_CALL_ACCEPTED} and
 * {@code INVOCATION_STREAM_READY} / {@code A2A_STREAM_READY} are deliberately
 * separate — accepting a Task and a stream becoming ready are distinct
 * observable events (FEAT-013 §2.3.4 / FEAT-014 §2.3.2, RFC 2119 MUST).
 *
 * <p>{@code INVOCATION_INPUT_REQUIRED} / {@code A2A_CALL_INPUT_REQUIRED} (FEAT-017)
 * project a Task's wait-for-input state as a bus response event so the gateway /
 * caller runtime can perceive it promptly — not only via a later GetTask. They
 * coexist with the FEAT-005 shadow-task resume mechanism: the event is the prompt
 * notification, the shadow task holds the recoverable resume context. This
 * reconciles the prior FEAT-013/014 L2 stance (INPUT_REQUIRED as a non-event) with
 * FEAT-017's RFC 2119 MUST that it be a published projection.
 *
 * <p>Forbidden-payload invariant (HD4): no event type carries a token chunk,
 * SSE frame, payload body, or Task execution state in the broker message
 * body; the discriminator is control-plane only.
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code architecture/L2-Low-Level-Design/agent-bus/
