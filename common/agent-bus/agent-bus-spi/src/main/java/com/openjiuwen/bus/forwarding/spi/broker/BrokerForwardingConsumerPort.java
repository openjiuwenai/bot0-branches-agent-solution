/**
 * Receiver-side broker SPI: subscribe once at startup, then poll (param-less)
 * for inbound messages and commit / reject them (Stage 26 T4 hybrid + decision
 * packet agent-bus-broker-filtering-spi-completion §3 "after").
 *
 * <p><b>Subscribe lifecycle (D4/D5).</b> {@link #subscribe} registers this
 * consumer's group ({@code consumerServiceId} — the broker consumer-group),
 * the route to consume (resolved to a topic by the adapter's
 * {@code ForwardingEndpointResolver}, never unwrapped — HD4), and the
 * {@link DeliveryFilter} (broker-agnostic named-property criteria — D3). The
 * broker consumer object lives entirely inside the adapter; callers never touch
 * {@code org.apache.rocketmq}. A real adapter may be called multiple times to
 * accumulate subscriptions across routes (one consumer-group, multiple topics);
 * {@link #poll} then returns the next message matching any subscribed filter.
 *
 * <p><b>Poll (param-less — D4).</b> {@link #poll} takes only the poll instant:
 * the consumer's group, route, and filter were fixed at subscribe time. The
 * implementation returns the next uncommitted message matching the subscribed
 * filter; a message whose properties do not match is never returned (the
 * receiver never sees other runtimes' traffic). The receiver processes it, then
 * {@link #commit commits} (model B ack-after-consume — at-least-once) or
 * {@link #reject rejects} on failure (not committed → redelivered).
 *
 * <p><b>Capability bit (D8).</b> {@link #supportsBrokerSidePropertyFilter}
 * exposes whether this adapter filters broker-side (RocketMQ SQL92) — correctness
 * is unaffected (the receiver only ever receives filter-matching messages either
 * way); the bit is a perf/observability surface so operators know whether the
 * broker pre-filters or the adapter degrades to client-side (Kafka / Redis
 * Streams cannot filter broker-side — D7).
 *
 * <p>Broker product concepts (topic / partition / offset / consumer-group /
 * filter expression) never escape this port — {@code consumerServiceId} is the
 * broker consumer-group materialised as a plain string, {@link BrokerInboundMessage}
 * exposes no offset, and {@link DeliveryFilter} is structured criteria (never a
 * SQL string — the {@code bySql} lives only in the RocketMQ adapter, D3).
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code docs/architecture/l0/10-governance/review-packets/
 * agent-bus-broker-filtering-spi-completion-decision.md} §3 (D3/D4/D5/D8) — delta
 * on {@code agent-bus-forwarding-runtime-transport-decision.md} (Stage 25 §4/§10).
