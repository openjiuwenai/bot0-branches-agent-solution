/**
 * Outcome of a single broker <em>produce</em> attempt, returned by
 * {@link BrokerForwardingRelayPort#produce} (Stage 26, T4 hybrid relay).
 *
 * <p><b>Deliberately NOT a {@code ForwardingDeliveryResult}.</b> A broker produce
 * is fire-and-forget: {@link Outcome#ACCEPTED} means the broker accepted the
 * message, NOT that the receiver processed it. The terminal ack (outbox ACKED)
 * arrives later via the model-B reverse-ack channel once the receiver consumes
 * and commits (Stage 27 AWAITING_ACK state machine). Conflating produce-accepted
 * with delivery-acked would lose the at-least-once guarantee. So the relay SPI
 * speaks {@code BrokerProduceOutcome}, and Stage 27 decides how the relay adapter
 * composes with {@code ForwardingDeliveryPort} / the worker.
 *
 * <p>Three outcomes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Outcome#ACCEPTED} → broker accepted the message (no failure code;
 *       the outbox record stays DISPATCHING / AWAITING_ACK until the reverse ack).</li>
 *   <li>{@link Outcome#UNAVAILABLE} → broker transiently unreachable / rejected
 *       (retryable failure code; the relay leaves the record for retry under the
 *       agent-bus retry policy — broker native retry is OFF, Stage 14 policy leads).</li>
 *   <li>{@link Outcome#ROUTE_NOT_FOUND} → the {@code ForwardingEndpointResolver}
 *       returned empty for the route handle (non-retryable; a route that cannot
 *       be mapped to a broker topic is a registry / configuration problem).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code docs/architecture/l0/10-governance/review-packets/
 * agent-bus-forwarding-runtime-transport-decision.md} (Stage 25 adopted-t4,
 * Stage 26 broker SPI scaffold).
