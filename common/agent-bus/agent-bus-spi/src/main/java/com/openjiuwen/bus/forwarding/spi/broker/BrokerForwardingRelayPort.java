/**
 * Relay-side broker SPI: produce a claimed outbox record onto a broker (Stage 26,
 * T4 hybrid).
 *
 * <p>The relay worker claims a {@link ForwardingOutboxRecord} from the outbox and
 * calls {@link #produce} to publish it. The implementation resolves the opaque
 * {@code routeHandle} to a broker topic via the injected
 * {@link ForwardingEndpointResolver} (HD4 preserved — the adapter never reads
 * {@code routeHandle.value()}), wraps the record into a
 * {@link BrokerOutboundMessage} (routing descriptor body + routing metadata
 * headers + conditional payloadRef), and publishes to the broker.
 *
 * <p><b>Not a {@code ForwardingDeliveryPort}.</b> {@link #produce} returns a
 * {@link BrokerProduceOutcome}, not a terminal {@code ForwardingDeliveryResult}:
 * a broker produce is fire-and-forget, and {@code ACCEPTED} means the broker
 * accepted the message — NOT that the receiver processed it. The terminal ack
 * (outbox ACKED) arrives via the model-B reverse-ack channel (Stage 27). Stage 26
 * ships this independent SPI; Stage 27 decides how the relay adapter composes
 * with the worker / {@code ForwardingDeliveryPort}.
 *
 * <p>Broker native retry is OFF — the agent-bus retry policy (Stage 14) leads, so
 * a {@link BrokerProduceOutcome.Outcome#UNAVAILABLE UNAVAILABLE} outcome surfaces
 * a retryable failure for the policy to schedule, never a double-retry.
 *
 * <p>Authority: {@code docs/architecture/l0/10-governance/review-packets/
 * agent-bus-forwarding-runtime-transport-decision.md} (Stage 25 adopted-t4 §4 / §10,
 * Stage 26 broker SPI scaffold).
